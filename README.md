# Coding guidelines

The goal of this repository is to provide a set of guidelines that can be used by all frontend developers in `Mazecare`. The guidelines are not meant to be a set of rules that must be followed at all times. They are meant to be a set of recommendations that should be followed as much as possible.

The guidelines are meant to be a living document that will be updated as the company grows and as new technologies are introduced.

## Enforcing the guidelines

In order to enforce these standards in your code, it is required to use ESLint and Prettier, with our accompanying [@mazecare/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mazecare/eslint-config) configurations.

## Table of Contents

To make understanding the guidelines easier, we have divided them into the following sections:

- [General](/general/README.md)
- [Git](/git/README.md)
- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [Vue](#vue)
- [React](#react)
